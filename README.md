## We have created an `IOS application` that will utilize `AI/ML` to determine the exact food `via a photo`.

> Features
- [x] The program will be able to upload/take photos for analysis.
- [x] Create ML Model using CreateML
- [x] IOS APP Integegration with ML Model

> Requirements
- [x] Upload/Take Photo for Analysis
  - [x] Get permission from apple device for camera access/library access.
  - [x] When the user presses the screen with one touch, use the camera for a photo 
  - [x] When the user presses screen with two touches, access the photo library for upload 
- [x] Create ML Model using CreateML
  - [x] Download Data Set from Kaggle of gigabytes of photos for food
  - [x] Use CreateML
   - [x] Upload all photos and set specific augmentations (crop, rotation, blur, exposure, noise, flip)
   - [x] Train Model
   - [x] Analyze to check accuracy with specific test cases and retrain if needed
   - [x] Extract the ML Model
   - [x] Implement ML Model into our IOS Swift Application    
- [x] Implement ML Model
 - [x] Move ML Model Into Model’s Folder with name “imagetest.mlmodel” 
 - [x] Implement ML MOdel into ImagePredidictor.swift
